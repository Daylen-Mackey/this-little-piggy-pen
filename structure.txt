Objective:

Our project must be able to:

    1) Capture an image of handwritten sentences to be "deciphered"
    2) Translate the sentence from ciphertext to plain text.

Means to achieve the goals with commentary:

The first goal:

    - Webcam connected to a computer 
        -> Capturing images on a front facing webcam can be a pain. 
        -> Since the webcam is connected to the computer building an application that will be relatively easy.

    - Using a phone
        -> Easier to capture images.
        -> Seperate system so we will need a way connect the phone application to an application on the computer, or have the entire application on the phone.

The second goal:
    
    - Sentence level translation

    - Character level translation
        -> Isolation of sentence and then characters
        -> Character search in dictionary: O(n) max, O(1) min. Search by common letters can increase speed.
